### Project Description
The project aims to create a comprehensive dashboard to analyze the road accident in the United Kingdom. We have tried to analyze the road accident reason by road surface, road type, vehicles involved and seriousness of the accident.

### Tools
- Excel: For data cleaning and visualization.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
 We have checked the data for the null values and duplicate values and removed the duplicate record. We have also created 33 new columns such as year, month, and days of the week to perform trend analysis. We have converted the raw data into the pivot table to perform the analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Performed some exploratory data analysis to find some information about key questions like
- How many are the fatal causalities and what total percentage of the entire accident is the fatal one?
- How many are the serious causalities and what total percentage of the entire accident is the serious one?
- How many are the slight causalities and what total percentage of the entire accident is the slight one?
- What are the total accidents by vehicle type?
- What are the causalities by area and light condition?
- Yearly trend in causalities.
- What are the causalities by road types and road surfaces?

### Data Analysis
To find the key answer to the question, we have created the pivot table and analyzed the data thereby arranging the data properly in rows, columns, and values accordingly as shown in the below screenshot.

### Results/Findings

[Road Accident Dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MxkBZF43wBFYyI2mQ45QPDbFdCv7vYjW/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115775133108482420179&rtpof=true&sd=true)
- Around 1.7% of the total accident is of fatal type.
- Most of the causalities is happening with the car.
- Most of the accident is happening in the daylight.
- Most of the accident is happening in the Single carriageway.
